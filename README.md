# Image Caption Generation

Image Caption Generation is one of the classic AI problem that uses both domains from NLP and CV making it a really interesting project. Objective of the system is to generate a caption( A one line description) about an Image which is accurate as much as possible. Please read the complete description and Readme to be clear about the implementation.

## Requirements

Minimum Requirements

1. Python with Keras and other importanyt libraries including tensorflow, numpy et cetera
2. 4GB RAM
3. Any Operating System would do
4. Ipynb editor like Jupyter or Ipython
5. Intel i3 7th Gen or above 

## Dataset Requirements 

We would be using Flickr8K_ dataset . As the name suggests the particular dataset contains around 8000 images with around 5 captions per image. The reason is because it is realistic and relatively small so that you can download it and build models on your workstation using a CPU.

The Dataset can be downloaded through the request form at this [Dataset Request](https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/1713398)
